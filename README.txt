Remake of Side_SBHTML to be compatible with XenHTML and iWidgets. Uses OpenWeatherMap as the weather API. 2017.

You can modify the widget to your liking in the Style.css. The "body" selector represents your screen. The "#bar" selector represents the widget. Modify the width and height values to your liking.

If the battery indicator is not working, ensure you have installed either InfoStats or InfoStats2.

If the weather is not showing, ensure you have set either your zip or your city in the Config.js file.
